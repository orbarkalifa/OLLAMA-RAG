    "# üß™ Exercise 3: PDF Question Answering using Chunking, Vector Search, and LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll complete a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** pipeline that:\n",
    "- Chunks and embeds the content of a PDF\n",
    "- Stores the chunks in an in-memory vector database (Qdrant)\n",
    "- Uses a local LLM to answer yes/no/unknown questions based strictly on the PDF content\n",

    "You will implement the missing components of this pipeline, focusing on document chunking, retrieval, and prompt construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Your objective is to build a system that can answer **yes**, **no**, or **unknown** questions based solely on the information in a given **PDF file**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The answer must be **one word only**: `\"Yes\"`, `\"No\"`, or `\"Unknown\"`\n",
    "- The LLM must not use external knowledge ‚Äî it must rely **only** on content retrieved from the PDF\n",
    "- The total prompt sent to the LLM is limited to **2000 characters**, including:\n",
    "  - The instruction\n",
    "  - Retrieved context chunks  \n",

    "### üß† What You Need to Do\n",
    "\n",
    "You must implement the following three core functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ `chunk_and_store(text: str) -> tuple[QdrantClient, SentenceTransformer]`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function prepares the document for retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Responsibilities:**\n",
    "- Chunk the input `text` into smaller segments\n",
    "- Encode each chunk into a vector using a pre-trained embedding model such as `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`\n",
    "- Store the vectors in an in-memory **Qdrant** database using `QdrantClient(\":memory:\")`\n",
    "- Store relevant metadata for each chunk (e.g., start offset, method)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Returns:**\n",
    "- `client`: a Qdrant client object that contains the embedded chunks\n",
    "- `model`: the SentenceTransformer model used for encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ `create_prompt(question: str, client: QdrantClient, model: SentenceTransformer) -> str`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function builds the prompt to be sent to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Responsibilities:**\n",
    "- Retrieve the top-k most relevant chunks from Qdrant using the question as a query\n",
    "- Construct a prompt that includes:\n",
    "  - A fixed instruction (you may define this in the function)\n",
    "  - The most relevant retrieved chunks\n",
    "- The full prompt must not exceed **400 characters**, excluding the question\n",
    "\n",

    "- A string containing the prompt (instruction + context), **excluding** the question\n",

    "- Optionally apply logic to enhance or adapt the query (e.g., pre-processing the prompt, logging, enforcing formatting rules)\n",
    "- Call the provided `call_llm(prompt, question)` function to actually interact with the model\n",
    "- Return the result unchanged, or with controlled, explainable adjustments **that do not modify the content of the LLM‚Äôs response**\n",

    "**Rules:**\n",
    "- ‚ùå Must **not** embed, re-embed, or analyze any part of the original document or its chunks\n",

    "- ‚úÖ Must **only** call `call_llm(prompt, question)` to obtain the response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Returns:**\n",
    "- A string (typically `\"Yes\"`, `\"No\"`, or `\"Unknown\"`) returned by the LLM, possibly post-processed for stability, format, or logging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "- This function acts as a controlled gateway to LLM usage, allowing improvements in how prompts are used or tracked, without modifying or reprocessing the document or query logic\n",

    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Creates a context-only prompt for an LLM by retrieving relevant chunks from a vector database \n",
    "    based on a user question, using a vector similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters:\n",
    "    ----------\n",
    "    question : str\n",
    "        The input question provided by the user. It should be a natural language query.\n",
    "\n",
    "    client : qdrant_client.QdrantClient\n",
    "        The Qdrant client connected to the database that contains stored and embedded text chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    model : sentence_transformers.SentenceTransformer\n",
    "        The SentenceTransformer model used to encode the input question into a vector embedding \n",
    "        for similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Behavior:\n",
    "    --------\n",
    "    1. The function encodes the input `question` into a vector using the provided `model`.\n",
    "    2. It queries the `client` (Qdrant database) using vector similarity search to find the most relevant chunks.\n",
    "    3. It assembles a prompt by combining the retrieved chunks and other info (but without adding the question itself).\n",
    "    4. The resulting prompt consists **only of context**, intended to be passed separately along with the question \n",
    "       in a later step when calling the LLM.\n",

    "        **The user's question is NOT included in the returned prompt.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Notes:\n",
    "    -----\n",
    "    - The search typically retrieves the top-k most similar chunks (e.g., top 5).\n",
    "    - Retrieved chunks are usually concatenated together, separated by delimiters (e.g., \"\\n\\n\").\n",
    "    - The question should be provided separately to the LLM after sending the prompt, or combined externally later.\n",
    "    - This function assumes that both the client and model are already initialized and ready to use.\n",
